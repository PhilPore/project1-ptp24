# project1-ptp24
CS490 project 1. Fun stuff. For music discovery.
=======
## Externals/APIs used:
=======
  * Flask Framework
  * Python Request Library
  * Python Random Library
  * Python OS library
  * Python dotenv library
  * Spotify API
  * Google Fonts for CSS

Upon acquisition of the repo contents, one will need to run the main.py file, and then open the given localhost address. Before this, one needs to set up a spotify developer account and save their credentials in a .env file. I'd recommend saving them to the same variable as I did, otherwise we might have a problem.

## Problems encountered
=======
   
Not many, to be frank. Smooth sailing so far.

## Future Plans
=======
  * Improve layout for site page.
  * Perhaps something to make the artists more random. Intent on depth searching with similar artists.
